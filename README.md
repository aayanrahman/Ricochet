Ricochet was a hackathon project built by a small team of passionate game developers who wanted to create a creative yet fun experience given the prompt "you are your own enemy". Made for Counter Spell, a Hack Club worldwide game jam!

## How to play 
1. Eliminate as many targets as possible by shooting them.
2. Avoid your own projectiles as they ricochet back at you!
3. Survive as long as possible through the waves!
